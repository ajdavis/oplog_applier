This is a series of GraphViz visualizations to accompany "Scope: Address tech
debt in Oplog Application Path". The base file oplog_applier.gv is a GraphViz
file that reflects the state of the OplogApplier code today. You can apply a
series of patches that illustrate how we plan to change the code.

This requires the "dot" tool from GraphViz and the "quilt" tool to manage the
series of patches. On Mac, "brew install quilt graphviz".

# Go to the initial state.
quilt pop -a

# Apply the next patch.
quilt push

# Undo the top patch.
quilt pop

# Show which patches are applied.
quilt applied

# To add a new patch to the series:
quilt push -a
quilt new NAME-OF-NEW-PATCH
quilt add oplog_applier/oplog_applier.gv
# ... make your modifications to oplog_applier.gv ...
quilt refresh

# Regenerate .png images of the graph - requires Python 3.6+.
python3 generate_graph_images.py
